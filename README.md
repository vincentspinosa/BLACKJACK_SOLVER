**Overview**

This is a powerful, browser-based tool for Blackjack players. It acts as an interactive coach, allowing you to play a real-life game of Blackjack while it keeps track of the cards, maintains the card count, and provides real-time, optimal strategy recommendations.

The tool combines perfect Basic Strategy with the Hi-Lo Card Counting system to give you the same edge a professional card counter would have..

This entire application runs in a single HTML file and requires no installation or internet connection after loading.

**Key Features**

Real-Time AI Recommendations: Get instant advice on whether to Hit, Stand, Double, Split, or Surrender.

Card Counting: Automatically tracks the Running Count and calculates the True Count based on deck penetration.

Strategic Bet Sizing: Recommends optimal bet sizes based on the current True Count.

Full Game Rule Customization: Set the number of decks, dealer rules (S17/H17), surrender options, and more to match the exact game you're playing.

Flexible Multi-Hand & Split Handling: Accurately handles complex scenarios, allowing you to split multiple times and play your hands in any order you choose.

Insurance Guidance: When the dealer shows an Ace, the application will display a clear on-screen message advising whether or not to take insurance based on the current true count.

Dynamic Player Seats: Simulate a real table experience. If a player's bankroll is depleted after a hand, or if he leaves the table between two hands, their seat will become empty. A new player can then join the game by being added to that open spot before the next hand begins.

Manual Card Input: You are in complete control. You tell the program which cards are dealt, making it a perfect tool for practicing with a real deck.

Zero Installation: Simply download the .html file and open it in any modern web browser.

**How to Use**

The main goal is to mirror a real card game in this application. You deal the cards physically, and then you input those same cards into the tool to receive strategic advice.

Step 1: Download and Open

Save the project's .html file to your computer.

Open the file with a web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

Step 2: Game Setup

You will be greeted with the "Game Setup" screen. Configure the options to match the rules of the game you intend to play:

Number of Players (1-7): Set how many player spots are at the table.

Number of Decks (1-8): Crucial for accurate True Count calculation.

Initial Bankroll / Min & Max Bet: Set your session's financial parameters.

Allow Surrender: Check this if the casino allows you to surrender your hand.

Dealer on Soft 17: Select whether the dealer Stands (S17) or Hits (H17) on a soft 17. This is a critical rule that affects strategy.

Click Start Game when you are ready.

Step 3: Placing Bets and The Deal

The game screen will appear. At the start of a new hand, the application will display the AI Recommended Bet for each player in their respective card area on the left.

In the middle column, a prompt will appear (e.g., Deal first card to Player 1).

Deal the card in your physical game.

In the right-hand column ("Deal a Card"), click the rank of the card that was just dealt.

The application will update and prompt you for the next card (e.g., Deal dealer's UP card).

Continue this process until all initial cards have been dealt.

Step 4: Playing a Hand

Once the deal is complete, the turn will move to the first player.

The AI Recommendation in the middle column will display the mathematically correct move (e.g., AI recommends: HIT).

Click the corresponding action button in the "User Actions" panel (e.g., Hit, Stand, Double).

If the action results in a new card being dealt (like hitting or doubling), the application will prompt you to select the card's rank from the panel on the right.

The application updates with the new hand value and provides the next recommendation. This cycle continues until you Stand or your hand is complete.

Step 5: Handling Splits

If you split a pair, the player area will update to show two separate hands.

You can click on any of your active hands to select it. The selected hand will be highlighted with a blue border.

All actions and dealt cards will be applied to the currently selected hand. This gives you the flexibility to play your split hands in any order, just like in a real casino.

Step 6: Next Hand

After all players and the dealer have finished their turns, the application will settle all bets and update bankrolls. Click the Start Next Hand button to begin the cycle again.
